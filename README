(0) Init Gradle:
Please run
	$ ./gradlew init
to init gradle.

(1) How To Build:
To build all three jar (Controller, Judge and Participant):
	$ ./gradlew buildAll

To build Controller:
	$ ./gradlew buildController

To build Judge:
	$ ./gradlew buildJudge

To build Participant:
	$ ./gradlew buildParticipant

To build Judge sandbox:
    $ cd isolote/
    $ make
    $ sudo ./fix_mod.sh
    $ ./isolate --init

The output directory of the Jars is './build/libs/'

(2) Configure file:
    You have to create a file, "config.txt", in the same working directory when running controller.
    Format: an information contains key and values, using ":" separated key and value, in one line.

    Keys: (Without quotation marks)
    "team" [Required]: Account data PATH for teams.
    "judge" [Required]: Account data PATH for judges.
    "problem" [Required]: Problem info data PATH.
    "port" [Optional]: controller port, default 8888
    "scoreboard" [Optional]: scoreboard http server port, default 8889

    Example:
    port:8888
    scoreboardport:8889
    team:Accountdata/team.txt
    judge:Accountdata/judge.txt
    problem:problem.txt

(3) Team account data format: 2-column csv format. The first column is account, and the second is password.
    Example:
    team01,team01
    team02,team02
    team03,team03
    team04,team04
    

(4) Judge account data format: 2-column csv format. The first column is account, and the second is password.
    Example:
    judge01,judge7122
    judge02,judge7122

(5) Problem info data format: 5-column or 6-column, column separated. Each column represents: (orderly)
    (a) Problem ID
    (b) Input data PATH
    (c) Output data PATH
    (d) Time limit (INT, second)
    (e) Memory limit (INT, KiloBytes)
    *(f) Special judge code PATH

    *f is optional.

    Example:
    ppA,Data/pA/pA.in,Data/pA/pA.out,1,65536
    ppB,Data/pB/pB.in,Data/pB/pB.out,1,65536
    ppC,Data/pC/pC.in,Data/pC/pC.out,1,65536
    ppD,Data/pD/pD.in,Data/pD/pD.out,1,65536,Data/pD/pD_special_judge.cpp

(6) How To Run:
	$ java -jar [name of jar]
    If there is any missing required configure file of controller, controller will terminate with exit code 1.
